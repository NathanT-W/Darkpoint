Known Bugs:
Soemtimes Ava can spawn off to the left side of the levels after a cutscene. Not sure what causes it, currently requires restart to fix. Only happens occasionally.
Sometimes the Cutscene sprites can stay on screen after a cutscene has finished playing, showing duplicates of the characters. Doesn't affect gameplay, can continue as normal.
The enemy AI in the second level sometimes ignores his turning points, meaning he walks wherever he wants without boundaries.
