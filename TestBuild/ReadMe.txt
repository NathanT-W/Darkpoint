Known Bugs:
Soemtimes Ava can spawn off to the left side of the levels after a cutscene. Not sure what causes it, currently requires restart to fix. Only happens occasionally.
Sometimes the Cutscene sprites can stay on screen after a cutscene has finished playing, showing duplicates of the characters. This happens when players finish a cutscene too quickly. Doesn't affect gameplay, can continue as normal.
Transition to level 3 not working, end of level 2 is end of game for now.
