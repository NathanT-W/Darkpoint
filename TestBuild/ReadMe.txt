Known Bugs:
Soemtimes Ava can spawn off to the left side of the levels after a cutscene. Not sure what causes it, currently requires restart to fix. Only happens occasionally.
Sometimes the Cutscene sprites can stay on screen after a cutscene has finished playing, showing duplicates of the characters. This happens when players finish a cutscene too quickly. Doesn't affect gameplay, can continue as normal.
The enemy AI doesn't reset playuers as he's meant to, will cause an error message on collision.
Level travel box at end of level 2 is not working. If you get to the end of level 2, you win, for now.
